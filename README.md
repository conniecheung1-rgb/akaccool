# Data Project

This project demonstrates foundational data analysis techniques using Python, including:

- Random sampling
- Stratified sampling
- Systematic sampling
- Descriptive statistics
- Working with datasets using pandas
- Applying AI-assisted coding techniques efficiently

## What I Learned

- How to load and explore datasets
- How to perform different sampling methods
- How to calculate summary statistics
- How to structure a Python script for reusable analysis
- How to use AI tools (ChatGPT/Gemini/Copilot) to accelerate coding
- How to version control a project using GitHub

## Project Files

- **Data sampling.py** — main script containing all code and sampling techniques

## Next Steps

- Add visualizations (matplotlib / seaborn)
- Add a notebook version (.ipynb) for interactive analysis
- Add automated tests
- Add a third portfolio project
